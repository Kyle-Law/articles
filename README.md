# Articles

> A simple web app for publishing articles

It's Ruby on Rails Capstone project of Microverse, which students have to build a real-world-like project with business specifications. Students are given 5 days to build the project upon receiving the project specifications.

This project follows the best practices , like setting-up a code linter, using gitflow testing business logic, writing good commit messages and an informative README.

It's inspired by Microverse's curriculum structures, where students have to write articles for each section as requirements of the software development program.

This project is built with Ruby On Rails and a little JavaScript.
